## Overview

The `addOverlapBorder` function applies a unique overlapping border style to an HTML element. You can customize properties like the border color, width, and style, along with an optional class name for further styling.

### Parameters

- `borderOptions` (**_optional_**): An object for customizing the overlapping border, including:
  - `borderColor`: Color of the border (default: COLOR_THEME.primary).
  - `borderWidth`: General border width (default: BORDER*SIZE.sm), with specific options for each side (e.g., borderTopWidth).
  - `borderStyle`: Style of the border (default: 'solid').
- className (***optional***): A custom class name to apply CSS styling to the container.

### Returns

An `HTMLDivElement` that wraps the original element with the overlapping border applied.
